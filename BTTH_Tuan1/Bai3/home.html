    <p><span style="color: rgb(136,72,36);">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span>
        After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many commentson your wonderful performances.
        <br> <br>
        I've started putting up a <a href="Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the 
        production. Please feel free to download the files 
        from the Web site. If you want high resolution 
        photos on a photo CD, please contact me. <br> <br>
        Once again: <span style="color: rgb(136, 72, 36);"><i>BRAVO!!!</i></span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
